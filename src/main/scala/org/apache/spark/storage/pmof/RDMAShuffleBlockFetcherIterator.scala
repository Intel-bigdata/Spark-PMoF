/**
  * An iterator that fetches multiple blocks. For local blocks, it fetches from the local block
  * manager. For remote blocks, it fetches them using the provided BlockTransferService.
  *
  * This creates an iterator of (BlockID, InputStream) tuples so the caller can handle blocks
  * in a pipelined fashion as they are received.
  *
  * The implementation throttles the remote fetches so they don't exceed maxBytesInFlight to avoid
  * using too much memory.
  *
  * @param context [[TaskContext]], used for metrics update
  * @param blockManager [[BlockManager]] for reading local blocks
  * @param blockTracker
  * @param blocksByAddress list of blocks to fetch grouped by the [[BlockManagerId.
  *                        For each block we also require the size (in bytes as a long field) in
  *                        order to throttle the memory usage.
  * @param streamWrapper A function to wrap the returned input stream.
  * @param maxBytesInFlight max size (in bytes) of remote blocks to fetch at any given point.
  * @param maxReqsInFlight max number of remote requests to fetch blocks at any given point.
  * @param maxBlocksInFlightPerAddress max number of shuffle blocks being fetched at any given point
  *                                    for a given remote host:port.
  * @param maxReqSizeShuffleToMem max size (in bytes) of a request that can be shuffled to memory.
  * @param detectCorrupt whether to detect any corruption in fetched blocks.
